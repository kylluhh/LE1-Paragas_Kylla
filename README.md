### My HTML/CSS Lab Experience: Struggling with Placements

I recently took on an HTML lab exercise, and it was quite the experience. As someone who just started learning HTML, I quickly discovered that placements were a real challenge for me.

When I sat down to build my webpage, I found myself overwhelmed with figuring out where to place different elements. There were headings, images, paragraphs, and links, and getting everything lined up the way I wanted was tough. I spent a lot of time adjusting margins and paddings, trying to make everything look neat and organized.

Debugging added to the struggle. Every time I made a change, I had to refresh my browser to see how it looked, and often, things didnâ€™t turn out as planned. It was frustrating to realize that something as simple as a misplaced tag could throw everything off. But through this process, I learned the importance of precision in coding.

Despite the difficulties, I also experienced some wins. When I finally got an image centered or a list properly formatted, it felt rewarding. Each small success motivated me to keep going, and I started to understand how the layout affects the overall design of a webpage.

In the end, my HTML lab was a mix of struggles and tears hahaha, but would surely take my time on learning it.
